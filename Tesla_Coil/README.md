Built a Tesla coil as an early hands-on electronics project to explore high-voltage generation, resonance, and electromagnetic energy transfer. 
Designed and assembled the circuit to step up voltage and produce visible high-frequency electrical discharges, gaining early exposure to concepts such as resonant circuits, 
inductive coupling, insulation, and electrical safety considerations. This project sparked my long-term interest in electrical engineering and practical circuit design.
