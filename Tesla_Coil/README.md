# Tesla Coil (Handheld Demonstration)

## Overview

This project involved the construction of a small handheld Tesla coil as an early introduction to high-voltage electronics and electromagnetic induction. The device was designed to generate a high-frequency, high-voltage electric field capable of wirelessly exciting nearby fluorescent bulbs.

The project was completed during my freshman year of high school and served as a foundational hands-on experience in circuit assembly, resonance, and electromagnetic field effects.

## Circuit Highlights

**Secondary Coil Assembly**  
The secondary coil was hand-wound using insulated wire wrapped around a PVC pipe, forming a resonant structure responsible for generating the high electric field.

**Capacitive Top Load**  
A foil-wrapped spherical object acted as a capacitive terminal, improving voltage buildup and field strength at the top of the coil.

**Wireless Excitation Demonstration**  
When a fluorescent bulb was brought near the operating coil, it illuminated without direct electrical contact, demonstrating energy transfer through the surrounding electric field.

## Results and Observations

The Tesla coil successfully generated a strong enough electric field to illuminate a nearby fluorescent bulb wirelessly. Operation confirmed proper resonance and coupling between the primary and secondary coils. The project demonstrated how high-voltage, low-current systems can safely produce visible electromagnetic effects.
