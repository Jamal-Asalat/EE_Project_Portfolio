4. **Diodes and Diode Circuits**  
   Experimental and simulated analysis of diode I–V characteristics, half-wave and full-wave rectifiers, capacitor filtering, and Zener diode voltage regulation.  
   `diodes_and_diode_circuits`
   
5. **Flip Flops and Sequential Circuits**  
   Design and hardware implementation of D-type latches, synchronous and ripple counters, and shift registers with timing and propagation delay analysis.  
   `flip_flops_and_sequential_circuits`
   
6. **Regulated DC Power Supply**  
   Design, simulation, and hardware verification of a Zener and op-amp based regulated DC power supply. The project evaluates load regulation, ripple reduction, and voltage stability under varying load conditions.

## Project Structure

Each project folder includes:
- A concise technical overview and design objectives
- Circuit schematics or block diagrams
- Experimental setup and methodology
- Measured results and engineering analysis
- Supporting documentation (reports, images, simulations)

These projects emphasize practical engineering design, testing, and real world implementation rather than purely theoretical work.
