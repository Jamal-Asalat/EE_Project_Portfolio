# Electrical Engineering Portfolio – Jamal Asalat

Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical Engineering) student at The City College of New York (ABET-accredited) with hands on experience in circuit design, analysis, and hardware focused electrical systems.

This repository contains selected academic and personal engineering projects demonstrating:

- Circuit analysis, simulation, and laboratory measurement  
- Power electronics, rectifiers, and regulated DC power supplies  
- Digital logic and timing circuits  
- Embedded systems and hardware focused system design  
- Practical engineering documentation, testing, and troubleshooting  

## Projects

Each project folder includes:
- A brief technical overview and design objective  
- Circuit schematics or block diagrams  
- Experimental setup and methodology  
- Measured results and engineering analysis  
- Supporting documentation (reports, photos, or simulations)  

These projects emphasize practical engineering design, testing, and real world implementation rather than purely theoretical work.

## Focus Areas
 
- Circuit design, testing, and measurement  
- Embedded and hardware-oriented engineering  
- Power systems and utilities  
- Power distribution and electrical infrastructure (academic focus)  
- Industrial electrical systems 

More projects will be added as coursework and independent work progress.
