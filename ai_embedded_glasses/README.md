# AI Embedded Wearable Glasses (Team Project – In Progress)

## Overview
This project is an ongoing development of AI-enabled wearable glasses designed to provide real-time contextual information and enhanced visual perception. Built collaboratively with a partner, the system integrates embedded hardware, computer vision, and edge AI to augment a user’s sensory experience. The glasses aim to detect, interpret, and display information directly to the wearer in real time.

This project reflects early-stage design and implementation work toward a novel wearable computing interface. It is actively being developed and refined, with foundational hardware and software prototypes already in place.
